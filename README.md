## Project Goals
Naming for human genetic diseases is complex. Diseases may be named for the phenotype; other information may be alluded to including the relevant gene, mode of inheritance, or the mechanism of disease. Diseases may be described at a high level with a generic name, or at a lower level with a more specific name; however, in the context of a variant in a specific gene, these differences may not be considered important. ClinVar data would be easier to ingest in bulk and to read in web displays if there were a meaningful way to aggregate diseases that effectively mean the same thing in the context of a gene.
